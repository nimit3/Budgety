# budgety

This is a simple budget calculator WEB APP which has been designed me in vanilla Javascript. In this app, you can add expenses and income and later in case if you want to delete any income and expense then you can do that too. Everytime after adding or deleting any specific expense and income it would automatically calculate the whole budget.
